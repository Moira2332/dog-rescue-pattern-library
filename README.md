fonts:
  primary: |
  I wanted a font that gave me lots of weight options and hierarchy options, that is also readable in web.

colors:
  primary: |
My primary color is meant to be pleasable to the eye and similar to the original colors but with more shades and allow the page to look cleaner.  
secondary: |
My secondary color is complimentary to the primary and stands out against it as an asset.
