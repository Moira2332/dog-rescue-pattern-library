The buttons use primary and secondary colours along with primary light and accent colour for the hover.

I wanted to use both colours to give myself options on any page say I change the background color I can change the button easily.

- The standard button (in both colours) is meant to be a transition button or submit button.
- The light button (in both colours) is meant to complement or become a secondary option after the standard button.
- The ghosts button is for images or for an accent on a solid colour page.
